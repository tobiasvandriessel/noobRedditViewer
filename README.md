# noobRedditViewer

<b>It is an app used to view Reddit's subreddits, it's noobish, so I'm open to any tips or recommendations!</b>

Right now I just get the subreddit entered and post the (hot) links in a list of cards, using the ionic platform, AngularJS, HTML and CSS. 

I'm having a few issues: I can't seem to get the video tag to work, because I have to replace the gifv extension with webm, but it's not working out for me.
